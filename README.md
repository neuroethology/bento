# The **B**ehavior **E**nsemble and **N**eural **T**rajectory **O**bservatory (Bento)

Bento is a tool for organizing, visualizing, and analyzing multimodal neuroscience datasets.

An earlier, Matlab-based version of Bento is available [here](https://github.com/neuroethology/bentoMAT).

## New In This Release

### Version 1.1.0
#### Added Features
- A plug-in interface to support import and display of pose data
- A pose plug-in for MARS format mouse pose data
- A pose plug-in for DeepLabCut format mouse pose data (*.h5, with *.csv coming in the next release)
- "Parula" color table for display of neural heatmap data

#### Bugs Fixed
- On initial startup when no Investigators yet exist, v1.0 would prompt for the selection of an Investigator anyway.
With this release, it takes you to the "Add Investigators" dialog instead.
- The vertical scaling of annotations has been fixed.
