# The **B**ehavior **E**nsemble and **N**eural **T**rajectory **O**bservatory (Bento)

Bento is a tool for organizing, visualizing, and analyzing multimodal neuroscience datasets.

An earlier, Matlab-based version of Bento is available [here](https://github.com/neuroethology/bentoMAT).

## New In This Release

### Version 0.2.0-beta
#### Added Features
- A plug-in interface to support import and display of pose data
- A pose plug-in for MARS format mouse pose data
- A pose plug-in for DeepLabCut format generic and MARS-style mouse pose data (*.h5, or *.csv)
- "Parula" color table for display of neural heatmap data
- Annotations can now be applied from the neural viewer window

#### Bugs Fixed
- On initial startup when no Investigators yet exist, v0.1.0-beta would prompt for the selection of an Investigator anyway.
With this release, it takes you to the "Add Investigators" dialog instead.
- The vertical scaling of annotations has been fixed.
