# Tutorial
This tutorial will walk you through the entire process of setting up Bento and working with data. Follow this tutorial using our sample dataset, then get started with your own data.

> ANN: once I've written this part, each ## header should be split into its own separate file within the tutorial folder, and the text below replaced with a hyperlinked table of contents.

## Initializing Bento
These steps will need to be followed the first time you run Bento.

### Before you begin
Bento constructs a database that keeps track of your data files. You can choose to manage data in two ways: in a local, private database or via a shared database.

- **Private** database hosting allows you to quickly install and start using Bento without installing additional software, however the built database cannot be easily shared by multiple users within a lab.
- **Shared** database hosting allows you to create a common lab-wide database to manage your group's experimental data. This configuration requires some additional effort to set up hosting on a server or network-attached storage device.

### Setting up a private database

### Setting up a shared database

## Preparing the database
Before you can start adding actual experiments, you'll need to provide a little background information for the database.

### Adding experimenters

### Adding animals

#### Tracking animal surgeries

### Adding camera profiles


## Populating the database
Now that you have experimenters, animals, and cameras on record, you can start using Bento to organize your experimental data.
